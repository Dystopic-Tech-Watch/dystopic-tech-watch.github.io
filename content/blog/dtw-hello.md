Dystopic Tech Watch is a space to have dialogue and put technology under a critical lens. Technology in many ways is the imperfect manifestation of our magical thoughts and desires. The desire to turn food from cold to hot. The desire to transport instantaneously from A to B. In spaces where the momentum of technology development is strong, like CMU, we ignore or overlook the ways that tech is driven by power and capital, and how the manifestations of their desires have had already had dark consequences - intended, or unintended.

There is a reason we focus on movies, books, media - art is the space where we interact with possibility, to bring us into contact with other realities and experiences in a social space. In ringing the alarm bell for misuse and abuse of technology, the question remains - what do we do in response? How do we act? Instead of carving out a window for survival - let's say, a diversity program for every corporation, institution - we want to be expansive, imaginative, pre-figurative, projective. We want to close our eyes for one second and create spaces of our own, for a world we configure ourselves.
